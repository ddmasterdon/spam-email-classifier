# spam-email-classifier

### This repo contains two notebooks which train and pre process ML models - one using traditional probability and the other using native Sckit-learn modules.

The emails are taken from [spam assassin corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/) and then sorted into dataframes and then trained using the both ways.
